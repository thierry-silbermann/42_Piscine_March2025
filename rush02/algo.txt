Algorithm to Convert an Integer to Words Using a Mapping File
Input

    A mapping file that contains predefined mappings of numbers to words (e.g., 1 -> one, 2 -> two, ..., 1000000 -> million).
    An integer N that needs to be converted into words.

Output

    A string representing the integer N in words.

Steps to Solve the Problem

    Load the Mapping File
        Read the file and store the mappings in a data structure (e.g., a dictionary where keys are numbers and values are words).

    Check for Direct Mapping
        If the integer N exists in the mapping, return its corresponding word immediately.

    Break the Number into Components
        If N is not directly mapped, break it into known components that exist in the mapping.
        Identify the largest known number smaller than N and recursively break down the remainder.

    Build the Word Representation
        Construct the word representation by combining the mapped words of components.
        Maintain the correct grammar and ordering (e.g., handle cases like "forty-two" or "one hundred and five").

    Handle Edge Cases
        Ensure numbers like 0, 100, 1000, 1000000 are correctly formatted.
        Properly handle hyphenation (twenty-one instead of twenty one).
        Manage spaces between large-number groupings (one thousand two hundred).

Example Walkthrough

Mapping File Contains:

1 -> one
2 -> two
3 -> three
...
10 -> ten
20 -> twenty
30 -> thirty
...
100 -> hundred
1000 -> thousand
1000000 -> million

Example 1: 42

    Direct lookup for 42 fails.
    Find the largest mapped number â‰¤ 42: 40 -> forty.
    Compute remainder: 42 - 40 = 2, and lookup 2 -> two.
    Combine result: "forty-two".

Example 2: 123

    100 -> hundred is the largest mapped value â‰¤ 123.
    Compute remainder: 123 - 100 = 23.
    23 is not directly mapped but can be broken into 20 (twenty) + 3 (three).
    Combine result: "one hundred twenty-three".

Example 3: 1050

    1000 -> thousand is the largest mapped value â‰¤ 1050.
    Compute remainder: 1050 - 1000 = 50.
    50 -> fifty is directly mapped.
    Combine result: "one thousand fifty".

Time Complexity Analysis

    Loading the file: O(M), where M is the number of mapped values.
    Lookup operations: O(1) for each mapped value (if using a dictionary).
    Breaking down numbers: O(log N) since numbers are decomposed hierarchically.
    Overall Complexity: O(log N) (efficient for large numbers).

Final Thoughts

    This approach ensures that any number (if its parts exist in the mapping) can be correctly translated.
    Uses recursion or iteration to break numbers into known components.
    The dictionary lookup ensures efficient performance.
    The final combination logic preserves correct grammar and formatting.

This structured approach guarantees that the program efficiently converts numbers to words using a limited mapping file. ðŸš€


------------------------



For 4,524, we will follow the structured breakdown approach using known mappings:
Step-by-Step Breakdown

    Find the Largest Mapped Number â‰¤ 4,524
        1000 -> thousand is the largest known number.
        4 -> four is mapped.
        First part: "four thousand"

    Compute Remainder
        4524 - 4000 = 524

    Find the Largest Mapped Number â‰¤ 524
        100 -> hundred is the largest known number.
        5 -> five is mapped.
        Second part: "five hundred"

    Compute Remainder
        524 - 500 = 24

    Find the Largest Mapped Number â‰¤ 24
        20 -> twenty is mapped.
        4 -> four is mapped.
        Third part: "twenty-four"

    Combine Everything
        "four thousand five hundred twenty-four"

Final Algorithm Summary for Any Number

    Check for a direct mapping in the dictionary. If found, return immediately.
    Find the largest known number smaller than or equal to N.
    Break the number into components:
        Subtract the identified largest known number from N.
        Recursively process the remainder.
    Format the output correctly:
        Insert "thousand", "hundred", and appropriate hyphenation where needed.
        Avoid unnecessary words like "zero" unless explicitly required.

This ensures that any number (as long as its parts exist in the file) can be correctly converted into words. ðŸš€
